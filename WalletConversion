If one tries to use an old wallet with the new client without having run the wallet with the salvagewallet switch once, the client will lock/crash. However, after running the client/daemon with the switch on the old wallet, conversion works great and the switch is no longer needed.

Linux users use a switch (--salvagewallet)  ./federationcredit --daemon --salvagewallet   or ./federationcredit-qt --salvagewallet

Windows users can use the convert.bat file to run the client with the salvagewallet switch.
